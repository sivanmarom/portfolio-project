## ✅ What’s Done So Far

### 📦 Development

- Built all React components (Hero, Skills, Projects, Contact, etc.).
- Structured code into clean and reusable components.
- Implemented basic backend API endpoint: `GET /api/hello`.
- Enabled CORS support with `flask-cors`.

---

### 🐳 Docker

- Created separate `Dockerfile`s for `frontend` and `backend`.
- Wrote `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate both services.
- Ensured networking between containers (frontend uses `backend` hostname).
- CORS issues resolved for cross-service requests.

---

### 🧪 CI with GitHub Actions

- Created workflow: `CI with Docker Compose` that:
  - Checks out the repo
  - Runs `docker-compose up --build`
  - Verifies backend with `curl http://localhost:5000/api/hello`
  - Verifies frontend with `curl http://localhost:3000`
  - Shuts down containers with `docker-compose down`

---

### 🐋 DockerHub Integration

- Added `docker-push` job to:
  - Build and tag Docker images (`latest`)
  - Push frontend & backend images to DockerHub
- Uses GitHub Secrets for secure authentication (`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`)

---

### ☁️ Deployment to Render

- Manually created two Render services:
  - `portfolio-frontend`: Static Site
  - `portfolio-backend`: Web Service on port 5000
- Dynamic domain handling in frontend via `window.location.hostname`
- Added GitHub Action `deploy-to-render` job to:
  - Trigger deployment via Render Deploy Hook Web URLs
  - Ensures latest Docker images are used automatically

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

### 🔧 Backend Improvements

- Add database (PostgreSQL or SQLite) for dynamic project management.
- Build full RESTful API with CRUD support for portfolio content.
- Add admin dashboard to manage messages from contact form.
- Extend Flask structure with Blueprints, error handling, and logging.

### 📈 Production Upgrades

- Add analytics (Google Analytics 4 / Hotjar).
- Integrate Sentry or similar tool for backend error logging.
- Set up staging environment for testing changes before production.
